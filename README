T1Subset v. 1.0

About
=====

T1Subset creates a subset of a PostScript Type 1 font. It is a header-only library as the complete functionalities are done in the header.

Note that only the unused glyphs are removed; subsetting of subroutines is not currently supported, although this may change in a future version.

In addition to the font's provided encoding, only the following 'built-in' encodings are currently supported: StandardEncoding, WinAnsiEncoding, and MacRomanEncoding.


Compilation
===========

Just include the header. See the test file for the usage.
